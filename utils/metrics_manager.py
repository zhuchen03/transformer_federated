    """Updates the metrics manager with metrics for a given round.

    This method updates the MetricsManager with a given nested structure of
    tensors `metrics_to_append`, at a given round number `round_num`. This
    method should only support strictly increasing, nonnegative round numbers,
    but not necessarily contiguous round numbers.

    For example, calling this method with `round_num = 3` then `round_num = 7`
    is acceptable, but calling the method with `round_num = 6` then
    `round_num = 6` (or anything less than 6) is not supported. As stated above,
    the `round_num` must also be nonnegative, so `round_num = 0` is supported,
    but `round_num < 0` is not.

    The `metrics_to_append` can be any nested structure of tensors. The actual
    metrics that are recorded are the leaves of this nested structure, with
    names given by the path to the leaf.

    Args:
      round_num: A nonnegative integer representing the round number associated
        with `metrics_to_append`.
      metrics_to_append: A nested structure of tensors.
